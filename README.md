# Static

Static files for me.

I need to show my updated activity data of different sources in my blog without using any backend services. Obviously, GitHub Actions is a great fit for this use case.

Just fork this repo and set up your own workflow if you want to use it. Make sure to add secrets for your source, which can be found in `.env.example`.

Use https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Lu-Jiejie/static@main/data/*.json to access the JSON files with fast speed.
